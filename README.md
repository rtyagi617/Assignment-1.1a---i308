Assignment 1.1a   308

A basic HTML/CSS Web Design project to showcase my interests and background. 

Your task is to create a new basic HTML page introducing yourself. This will be a way for your instructors to get to know you. If you have concerns about privacy, feel free to lie. We'll judge you on the quality of the web page, not the truthfulness of its content.

This site must be a newly constructed site. Any reuse of a website or sites such as ChatGPT will be considered academic misconduct.

You may include an external CSS page for styling if you like, as long as it is your own CSS page. You may not use templates or other external stylesheets. The only exception is the Skeleton grid (from I101) if you want to use an external CSS for structure only.

The website must be appropriate for viewing in an academic setting, but the more creative your page is and the better your design is, the more points you will receive to achieve the maximum grade.
Dreamweaver (and similar tools) or the use of templates is not permitted for any part. Write your HTML code using a text editor of your choice.

The webpage can be of any HTML document type.

You must validate your HTML page. You can find a validator at https://validator.w3.org/Links to an external site.

Please validate your page as the doctype that you choose, or leave it as auto. 

The website must validate with no errors (warnings are okay).

Your page must incorporate at least 8 of the following 12 items:

At least one HTML table

At least four DIV tags

At least two SPAN tags

At least three clickable (non-dead!) links

At least one list with at least three items in the list

At least two images (not counting a banner), of which at least one must be a non-dead link

At least two different levels of headings

A background color other than the default and/or a background image

A banner image of your own creation

Text modified at least three different ways

At least three of the following tags: STRONG VAR EM CITE CODE ACRONYM ABBR

At least three of the following tags: P BR PRE DIV BLOCKQUOTE
